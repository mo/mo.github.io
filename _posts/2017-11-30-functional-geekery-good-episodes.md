Lately, I've been listening to a podcast about functional programming called [Functional Geekery](https://www.functionalgeekery.com/). I ended up eventually listening to the entire backlog of episodes, but if you
just want to see what the podcast is about, below you'll find a list of good episodes. The first few minutes
usually lists a bunch of functional programming conferences, just skip past those if you're listening to old
episodes.

* [Bartosz Milewski](https://www.functionalgeekery.com/episode-69-bartosz-milewski/). Category theory.

* [Brian Lonsdorf](https://www.functionalgeekery.com/episode-51-brian-lonsdorf/). Category theory, Frisby videos, JavaScript, PureScript.

There are several other incredibly interesting episodes. These ones above are just a few ones that came to mind when I scrolled through the episode list again quickly. Also don't miss the show notes, they are often a treasure trove of
links to good papers and videos.

Huge thanks to Steven Proctor for creating this amazing podcast!
